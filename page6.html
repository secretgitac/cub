    <h1>Word of Poetry to Make you Happy</h1>
    <div>
        <p>
When I first met you <br>
I felt like I had known you forever,<br>
telling you my secrets<br>
and what I didn't want ever.<br>
you listened to me<br>
I bet you thought I'd never end,<br>
who would have thought<br>
we would become more than just friends.<br>
Over a period of time,<br>
I got to know the real you.<br>
A boy so caring and gentle,<br>
with a heart so true.<br>
You've survived your life<br>
with hurt and loneliness by your side.<br>
I told you I'd never leave<br>
because of the feelings I have inside.<br>
        </p>
